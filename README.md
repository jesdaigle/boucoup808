This was bootstrapped with create-react-app. 
Yarn install
Yarn start
Will get the project up and running. There are some known bugs with tonejs that I ran out of time to address. Many of the requirements were met, some were not. I should also note that I'm not a graphic designer by any means. I can turn designs into code but my ability to design is admittedly a muscle I haven't flexed often. 
I was greatly inspired by a drumkit done in Ember that I discovered while trying to find inspiration: 
http://emberbeats.gavinjoyce.com as well as https://gogul.dev/software/deep-drum. 
Had I had the time, I would have taken this further and tried to build something similar to those.
